This repo will soon be populated with the implementation of Latent RANSAC.

## Basis of our code

Since we based our on (and compared to) USAC, we forked this repository from cr333/usac-cmake who ported it to camke format. 

The original USAC source code (in branch 'usac') is available from:
http://www.cs.unc.edu/~rraguram/usac/

CMake/Mac porting by Christian Richardt (http://richardt.name).
